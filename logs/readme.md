# Control UI Log Files
Here are log files that can be saved and loaded with Control UI.

I put a small example file with video data here where the robot jumps. Note that the right leg encoder seems to have malfunctioned in this jump a little bit and caused the robot to think that is started landing before it actually did. It still did land successfully though somehow.

I limited the file to the actual jump to save some space (these files can get quite huge).
